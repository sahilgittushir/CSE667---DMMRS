## 📚 Course Overview

> **Instructor:** Prof. Dr. Tanmoy Kundu  
> **Institution:** IIIT-Delhi  
> **Term:** Spring 2025  
> **Credits:** 4  
> **Evaluation Components:** Assignments (60), Midsem (30), Endsem (40), Project (20)

This course introduces **strategic decision making**, **game theory**, **planning under uncertainty**, and **belief modeling** within the context of autonomous robotic systems and multi-agent coordination.

Students are trained to use tools such as **linear programming**, **entropy-based models**, **mutual information metrics**, and **dominant strategy analysis** to design intelligent behavior for autonomous systems.
